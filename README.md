# Public Repository

This repository has been created for educational purposes. Source code from here shouldn't be reused, as it might not be the easiest alternative, or it might be buggy and therefore you should star the repository to stay up-to-date.

Few things to keep in mind:

	::Don't make modifications. You can contact me at wnowicki04_git@o2.pl if you have an issue, however no changes can be made to your own accord.

	::I am still learning, just as you are. Refer to previous note in case of any problems.

	::If you're doing some kind of homework, don't just rip code from here. Try to figure it out on your own using what you've learned, not just plagiarise.

	::**DON'T** inform me that I should add any default libraries, the code is supposed to run on most devices.
